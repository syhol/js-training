# JS Training

Run npm install.

Implement the solution in the top function for each file.

DO NOT edit the tests.

You must make the tests pass.

Start with `01-reverse-an-array.js` and work your way through.

Run the test commands while you try to implement the solution, e.g.

* While working on `01-reverse-an-array.js` run `npm run test1`
* While working on `02-split-a-string.js` run `npm run test2`
* ...and so on...
